# Hangman Game  

## 📝 Description  
**NOTE:** I do not plan to modify this app any further.  

This is a classic Hangman game developed in **WPF C#**, created as my second project in my **1st year of programming studies** (after the **C# Calculator**). The game includes:  
- A **words.txt** file where you can modify the custom word list (originally in French).  
- Background **music** for immersion (copyright-free).  
- A **simple UI**—not fancy, but clean and functional—for clicking letters to guess the word.  
- A **lives system**, as expected in a Hangman game.  

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage  
Since I never built the app into an `.exe` (and do not plan to), you will need **Visual Studio** to run it.  

### Steps to Open the Project:  
1. Clone the repository:  
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/Akieldamas/Hangman-Game.git
  ```
