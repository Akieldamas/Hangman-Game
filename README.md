# Hangman Game
## 📝 Description
**NOTE:** I do not plan to modify the app any more in any way.
This is a classic Hangman game developed in WPF C#, the second project made for my programming class in my 1st year of superior studies. The game includes:
* A **words.txt** file where you can change the custom words, as the game was originally made in french.
* Background music for immersion. (Copyright Free)
* A simple UI (not amazing but simplistic) for the players to click on letters to guess the word.
* A system with lives, since it's how the Hangman game works.

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage
Since I didn't make the app into an .exe (and not planning to), you'll have to open the solution in **Visual Studio**.
1. Clone the repository or download the file or open with Visual Studio:
   ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hangman-game.git
   ```
Not super proficient in the field but you can use Git to use these commands: [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
Or you can press on the Code button in Github to download as a ZIP or open in Visual Studio:
